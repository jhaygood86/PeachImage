/// Inverts VP8L's predictor (spatial) transform: per tile (side <c>1 &lt;&lt; transform.Bits</c>), one of 14
/// predictor modes (0-13, selected via the tile parameter sub-image's green channel) forecasts each pixel
/// from its already-reconstructed left/top/top-left/top-right neighbors; the encoded residual is then added
/// back, per channel, mod 256. Two positions are unconditionally overridden regardless of what the tile
/// image says (matching libwebp's <c>PredictorInverseTransform_C</c> exactly): pixel (0,0) always uses mode 0
/// (fixed opaque black), and every other pixel in row 0 always uses mode 1 (left) — there is no row above
/// image row 0 for any tile-selected mode to sensibly reference.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// All neighbor reads use flat, unclamped <c>index +/- 1 +/- width</c> arithmetic against the single flat
/// pixel buffer, deliberately including one quirk this must reproduce exactly to match the reference decoder:
/// at the last column of a row, the "top-right" neighbor read (<c>index - width + 1</c>) is one past the end
/// of the row above, which — because the buffer is contiguous row-major memory — actually lands on the
/// *current* row's own first pixel (already reconstructed by the time it's read, since column 0 of every row
/// is always handled before the rest of that row). This is intentional per the VP8L spec/libwebp, not a bug
/// to guard against; both encoder and decoder rely on it.
